**HP Laptop Manager** is a native Linux application designed to unlock the full potential of HP Omen and Victus series laptops. It serves as an open-source alternative to the official OMEN Gaming Hub, providing essential controls in a modern, user-friendly interface.

**New in v4.7:**
- 💫 **UI Hover Enhancements**: Added smooth glassmorphic scale and glow interactions to Dashboard Quick Actions, Performance Slider, and MUX/Fan profile buttons.
- 💡 **Dynamic Power Tooltips**: Power Profiles (ECO/Balanced/Performance) now feature intelligent mouse-hover tooltips reflecting real-time CPU/GPU hardware limits.
- 🏷️ **Global Tab Rename**: The Fan tab is now globally unified as the "Performance" Hub (Performans in Turkish).
- 📊 **Dashboard Segmented Control**: Integrated native GTK Segmented Control for power profiles inside the Dashboard, matching the sleek Fan page styling.
- ✨ **Unified Kernel Driver**: `hp-omen-core` companion driver with DKMS for out-of-the-box fan and RGB support without conflicts.
- 💤 **Smart GPU Sleep**: The background daemon natively detects if the discrete GPU (dGPU) is suspended (e.g., `d3cold`) and refrains from polling `nvidia-smi`.
- ⌨️ **Omen Key Support**: Pressing the physical Omen Key natively opens the manager GUI via lightweight input listening.
- 📝 **TOML Configuration**: Modern config management with automatic migration from older JSON settings.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 RGB Lighting Control
- **4-Zone Control**: Customize colors for different keyboard zones.
- **Effects**: Static, Breathing, Wave, Cycle.
- **Brightness & Speed**: Adjustable parameters for dynamic effects.

### 📊 System Dashboard
- **Real-time Monitoring**: CPU/GPU temperatures and Fan speeds.
- **Performance Profiles**: One-click power profile switching (requires `power-profiles-daemon`).

### 🌪️ Fan Control
- **Standard Mode**: Intelligent software-controlled fan curve for balanced noise/performance.
- **Max Mode**: Forces fans to maximum speed for intensive tasks.
- **Custom Mode**: Drag-and-drop curve editor to create your own fan profiles.

### 🎮 GPU MUX Switch
- Switch between **Hybrid**, **Discrete**, and **Integrated** modes.
- *Note: Requires compatible tools like `envycontrol`, `supergfxctl`, or `prime-select`.*
