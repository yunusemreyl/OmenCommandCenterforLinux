**HP Laptop Manager** is a native Linux application designed to unlock the full potential of HP Omen and Victus series laptops. It serves as an open-source alternative to the official OMEN Gaming Hub, providing essential controls in a modern, user-friendly interface.

**New in v1.1.5:**

- 🚀 **OMEN 16 (2024) Support**: Added official support for 14th Gen OMEN models (Board ID 8C77).
- 🌪️ **Kernel WMI Fixes**: Resolved the "Query 0x4c error 0x6" issue with advanced thermal fallback and updated custom drivers.
- 📦 **Resource Monitoring**: Redesigned Dashboard gauges to use modern, boxed linear bars for **Disk, RAM, and Battery**.
- 🎹 **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Renamed Keyboard page to "Shortcuts" (Kısayollar) with permanent hardware fixes for PrtSc and F1 keys via `udev`.
- 🧹 **UI Streamlining**: Removed legacy 'Games' and 'Tools' pages to focus on core hardware control and optimize startup performance.
- 🔧 **Diagnostics Upgrade**: Enhanced "Driver Status" and improved debug logging reliability for newer kernel versions.
- 🖼️ **Branding Updates**: Integrated official OMEN/Victus logos and refined technical descriptions for a more premium experience.

**New in v1.1.4:**

- ⚡ **Daemon Optimization**: Optimized core service, reducing CPU usage to ~1%.

**New in v1.1.3:**

- 🎹 **Keyboard Shortcuts & Hardware Fixes**: New dedicated page for OMEN/Victus hotkeys, Windows Key lock (F10), and hardware fixes for PrtSc/F1.
- 🌈 **8-Zone RGB Support**: Expanded lighting control to support high-end OMEN models with 8-zone keyboards.
- 🛠️ **Driver Install Fixes**: Resolved the `cp: target '/usr/src/...' No such file or directory` error and improved DKMS header detection.
- 🔄 **State Restoration**: Windows Key lock and 8-zone colors are now correctly restored after a reboot.

**New in v1.1.2:**

- ⚡ **Interactive Power Manager Selection**: During installation, users can now choose between `power-profiles-daemon`, `ppd-tuned` (recommended for Fedora), `TLP`, or `auto-cpufreq`.
- 🛠️ **Pure DKMS Implementation**: Unified driver installation with pure DKMS support. Redundant manual build steps removed, and robust kernel header detection added for Arch-based (CachyOS, Zen), Fedora, and Debian distros.
- 🔧 **Unified Setup Tool**: Replaced separate `install.sh`, `uninstall.sh`, and `update.sh` with a single, robust `./setup.sh` tool.
- 🔋 **Enhanced Conflict Detection**: Integrated links to TLP and auto-cpufreq repositories for better user guidance during dependency installation.

**New in v1.1.1:**

- 🔋 **TLP / auto-cpufreq Support**: The app now detects if TLP or auto-cpufreq is managing power profiles and gracefully disables the built-in power mode controls with a clear notification on both the Dashboard and Fan pages.
- 🖥️ **GPU MUX Tool Installer**: During installation, if no GPU switching tool (`envycontrol` or `prime-select`) is detected, the installer now offers an interactive menu to install one.
- 🐞 **Debug Information Panel**: A new "Debug Information" section has been added to the Settings page. Users can copy system info (kernel, modules, service status) to the clipboard with one click for easy troubleshooting.
- ⚡ **Performance Optimizations**: Reduced unnecessary `systemctl` calls by caching conflict checks. TLP/auto-cpufreq status is now only polled every ~25-50 seconds instead of every refresh cycle.
- 🔧 **In-App Updater Fix**: The auto-updater now uses `setup.sh update` and a simplified, more robust version comparison algorithm.

**Previous Releases:**

**v1.1.0:**

- ✨ **Name Change**: `hp-omen-core` has been renamed to `hp-rgb-lighting` to better reflect its function and support Victus devices appropriately.
- 🔄 **Kernel 7.0+ Adaptation**: Updated internal checks. Fan control logic defaults to stock `hp-wmi` on kernels >= 7.0, and auto-installs our custom `hp-wmi` module on kernels < 7.0.
- 🚀 **setup.sh update**: Easily adapt to new kernel updates and ensure old `hp-omen-core` debris is purged from your system with one simple update command.

**Previous Releases:**

**v1.0.1:**

- 🟢 **Minimal Fixes**: Small stability improvements and minor bug fixes.

**v1.0.0:**

> 📦 **Versioning Change**: Starting with this release, the project adopts **Semantic Versioning** (`major.minor.patch`) for a more professional and standardized release cycle. Previous versions (v4.x) have been remapped accordingly.

- 🔄 **Stock HP WMI Support**: On kernel 7.0+, the application now uses the **original HP WMI driver** shipped with the kernel for fan control — no custom WMI module needed.
- 🛠️ **Legacy Kernel Support**: For kernels **below 7.0**, the custom 7.0 WMI driver (`hp-wmi`) is still bundled and the installer automatically installs it alongside `hp-rgb-lighting`.
- ⚠️ **Secure Boot Notice**: Keyboard RGB control (`hp-rgb-lighting`) is **not compatible with Secure Boot**. If Secure Boot is enabled, the `hp-rgb-lighting` module cannot be loaded and keyboard lighting features will be unavailable. You must **disable Secure Boot** in BIOS to use keyboard control.
- 🔥 **Automatic Updates**: Check for and install updates directly from the Settings page — no need to re-clone or download manually.
- 🌡️ **Accurate GPU Temperature**: Fixed GPU temperature detection — correctly uses `nvidia-smi` with auto-detected PCI path, and never falls back to CPU package temperature.
- 🎨 **Performance Mode Colors**: Dashboard performance buttons now use distinct colors (green/blue/orange) instead of emojis.
- 🔋 **Battery-Safe GPU Polling**: Dashboard no longer wakes the dGPU from sleep — checks PCI suspend state before polling `nvidia-smi`.
- ⚡ **Smooth CPU Readings**: CPU usage display uses EMA smoothing to eliminate rapid fluctuations.
- 🎮 **Non-Blocking Game Scan**: Game library scanning runs in background — no more UI freezing when opening the Games tab.

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 RGB Lighting Control
- **4-Zone Control**: Customize colors for different keyboard zones.
- **Effects**: Static, Breathing, Wave, Cycle.
- **Brightness & Speed**: Adjustable parameters for dynamic effects.

### 📊 System Dashboard
- **Real-time Monitoring**: CPU/GPU temperatures and Fan speeds.
- **Performance Profiles**: One-click power profile switching (requires `power-profiles-daemon`).

### 🌪️ Fan Control
- **Standard Mode**: Intelligent software-controlled fan curve for balanced noise/performance.
- **Max Mode**: Forces fans to maximum speed for intensive tasks.
- **Custom Mode**: Drag-and-drop curve editor to create your own fan profiles.

### 🎮 GPU MUX Switch
- Switch between **Hybrid**, **Discrete**, and **Integrated** modes.
- *Note: Requires compatible tools like `envycontrol`, `supergfxctl`, or `prime-select`.*

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- A Linux distribution (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, OpenSUSE, etc.)
- `git` installed

### Install
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yunusemreyl/LaptopManagerForHP.git
cd LaptopManagerForHP

# Run the installer (requires root)
chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh install
```

The installer will automatically:
1. Detect your package manager and install dependencies.
2. Detect your kernel version and install the appropriate driver:
   - **Kernel ≥ 7.0**: Only installs `hp-rgb-lighting` (RGB). Fan control is provided by the stock `hp-wmi` module.
   - **Kernel < 7.0**: Installs both the custom `hp-wmi` driver (backported) and `hp-rgb-lighting`.
3. Install the daemon and GUI components.
4. Set up system services.
5. Provide a troubleshooting guide if issues occur.

> ⚠️ **Secure Boot Warning**: The `hp-rgb-lighting` kernel module (keyboard RGB control) **cannot be loaded** when Secure Boot is enabled. If you need keyboard lighting control, you must disable Secure Boot from your BIOS settings. Fan control and other features work normally regardless of Secure Boot status on kernel 7.0+.

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

To completely remove the application and its services:

```bash
cd LaptopManagerForHP
sudo ./setup.sh uninstall
```
